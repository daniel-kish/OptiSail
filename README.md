# OptiSail

## About
In this project optimization of a sailing boat course is performed. When sailing the boat can only be driven with wind and there is a huge problem when you need to reach a distant point and the direction towards it is perfectly opposite to that of the wind. So how can we move the boat while moving against the wind? Well, there is a sailing technoque that leverages counterintuitive properties of a sail to move in a way that in sailing terms is refered to as *tacking*. 
When tacking boat is stirred to move roughly at a 45 degrees angle with the wind as shown on the figure below.

Here we can see that
